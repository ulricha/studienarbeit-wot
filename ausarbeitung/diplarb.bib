  abstract = {The ubiquity of modular structure in real-world complex networks is
	the focus of attention in many trials to understand the interplay
	between network topology and functionality. The best approaches to
	the identification of modular structure are based on the optimization
	of a quality function known as modularity. However this optimization
	is a hard task provided that the computational complexity of the
	problem is in the non-deterministic polynomial-time hard (NP-hard)
	class. Here we propose an exact method for reducing the size of weighted
	(directed and undirected) complex networks while maintaining their
	modularity. This size reduction allows use of heuristic algorithms
	that optimize modularity for a better exploration of the modularity
	landscape. We compare the modularity obtained in several real complex-networks
	by using the extremal optimization algorithm, before and after the
	size reduction, showing the improvement obtained. We speculate that
	the proposed analytical size reduction could be extended to an exact
	coarse graining of the network in the scope of real-space renormalization.},

  abstract = {Measuring the centrality of nodes in real-world networks has remained
	an important task in the technological, social, and biological network
	paradigms carrying implications on their analysis and applications.
	Exact inference of centrality values is infeasible in large networks
	due to the need to solve the all-pairs shortest path problem. We
	introduce a framework to approximate node centralities in real-world
	networks that are known to exhibit modularity, i.e., the presence
	of dense subgraphs or communities, which are themselves sparsely
	connected. We also propose a novel centrality measure known as Community
	Inbetweenness that ranks nodes based solely on community information.
	In a modular network of size n with n(1/2) evenly sized communities
	and m edges, our framework requires linear time O(m) and O(nm) time
	for the approximation of closeness and betweenness respectively.
	Utilizing a recently proposed linear time method in community detection,
	our approximation techniques are faster than traditional sampling
	algorithms, applicable in real-time distributed environments, and
	offer highly comparable results.},

  abstract = {Recent years have seen that WWW is becoming a flourishing social media
	which enables individuals to easily share opinions, experiences and
	expertise at the push of a single button. With the pervasive usage
	of instant messaging systems and the fundamental shift in the ease
	of publishing content, social network researchers and graph theory
	researchers are now concerned with inferring community structures
	by analyzing the linkage patterns among individuals and web pages.
	Although the investigation of community structures has motivated
	many diverse algorithms, most of them are unsuitable for large-scale
	social networks because of the computational cost. Moreover, in addition
	to identify the possible community structures, how to define and
	explain the discovered communities is also significant in many practical
	scenarios. In this paper, we present the algorithm ComTector(Community
	DeTector) which is more efficient for the community detection in
	large-scale social networks based on the nature of overlapping communities
	in the real world. This algorithm does not require any priori knowledge
	about the number or the original division of the communities. Because
	real networks are often large sparse graphs, its running time is
	thus O(C Tri2), where C is the number of the detected communities
	and Tri is the number of the triangles in the given network for the
	worst case. Then we propose a general naming method by combining
	the topological information with the entity attributes to define
	the discovered communities. With respected to practical applications,
	ComTector is challenged with several real life networks including
	the Zachary Karate Club, American College Football, Scientific Collaboration,
	and Telecommunications Call networks. Experimental results show that
	this algorithm can extract meaningful communities that are agreed
	with both of the objective facts and our intuitions.},

	and change-point detection on dynamic weighted directed graphs(DWDG).
	Real networks such as e-mail, co-author and financial networks can
	be modeled as DWDG. Community mining on DWDG has not been studied
	thoroughly, although that on static(or dynamic undirected unweighted)graphs
	has been exploited extensively. In this paper, Stream-Group is proposed
	to solve community mining on DWDG. For community discovery, a two-step
	approach is presented to discover the community structure of a weighted
	directed graph(WDG) in one time-slice: (1)The first step constructs
	compact communities according to each node's single compactness which
	indicates the degree of a node belonging to a community in terms
	of the graph's relevance matrix; (2)The second step merges compact
	communities along the direction of maximum increment of the modularity.
	For change-point detection, a measure of the similarity between partitions
	is presented to determine whether a change-point appears along the
	time axis and an incremental algorithm is presented to update the
	partition of a graph segment when adding a new arriving graph into
	the graph segment. The effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithms
	are validated by experiments on both synthetic and real networks.
	Results show that our algorithms have a good trade-off between the
	effectiveness and efficiency in discovering communities and change-points.},

	total size of the network and on the degree of interconnectedness
	of the modules, even in cases where modules are unambiguously defined.
	This finding is confirmed through several examples, both in artificial
	and in real social, biological, and technological networks, where
	we show that modularity optimization indeed does not resolve a large
	number of modules. A check of the modules obtained through modularity
	optimization is thus necessary, and we provide here key elements
	for the assessment of the reliability of this community detection

	in networks. A community is often though of as a set of nodes that
	has more connections between its members than to the remainder of
	the network. In this paper, we characterize as a function of size
	the statistical and structural properties of such sets of nodes.
	We define the network community profile plot, which characterizes
	the "best" possible community - according to the conductance measure
	- over a wide range of size scales, and we study over 70 large sparse
	real-world networks taken from a wide range of application domains.
	Our results suggest a significantly more refined picture of community
	structure in large real-world networks than has been appreciated
	previously. Our most striking finding is that in nearly every network
	dataset we examined, we observe tight but almost trivial communities
	at very small scales, and at larger size scales, the best possible
	communities gradually "blend in" with the rest of the network and
	thus become less "community-like." This behavior is not explained,
	even at a qualitative level, by any of the commonly-used network
	generation models. Moreover, this behavior is exactly the opposite
	of what one would expect based on experience with and intuition from
	expander graphs, from graphs that are well-embeddable in a low-dimensional
	structure, and from small social networks that have served as testbeds
	of community detection algorithms. We have found, however, that a
	generative model, in which new edges are added via an iterative "forest
	fire" burning process, is able to produce graphs exhibiting a network
	community structure similar to our observations.},

	statistical properties of both networks. We claim      that the result
	can be understood at the mesoscopic scale, by studying the      community

	employed to assign a structural community to each scholar in the
	network: leading eigenvector, walktrap, edge betweenness and spinglass.
	Socioacademic characteristics were gathered from the scholars and
	include such information as their academic department, academic affiliation,
	country of origin, and academic position. A Pearson's χ 2 test, with
	a simulated Monte Carlo, revealed that structural communities best
	represent groupings of individuals working in the same academic department
	and at the same institution. A generalization of this result suggests
	that, even in interdisciplinary, multi-institutional research groups,
	coauthorship is primarily driven by departmental and institutional

	The result is a map that both simplifies and highlights the regularities
	in the structure and their relationships. We illustrate the method

  abstract = {In this paper, we consider the problem of combining link and content
	analysis for community detection from networked data, such as paper
	citation networks and Word Wide Web. Most existing approaches combine
	link and content information by a generative model that generates
	both links and contents via a shared set of community memberships.
	These generative models have some shortcomings in that they failed
	to consider additional factors that could affect the community memberships
	and isolate the contents that are irrelevant to community memberships.
	To explicitly address these shortcomings, we propose a discriminative
	model for combining the link and content analysis for community detection.
	First, we propose a conditional model for link analysis and in the
	model, we introduce hidden variables to explicitly model the popularity
	of nodes. Second, to alleviate the impact of irrelevant content attributes,
	we develop a discriminative model for content analysis. These two
	models are unified seamlessly via the community memberships. We present
	efficient algorithms to solve the related optimization problems based
	on bound optimization and alternating projection. Extensive experiments
	with benchmark data sets show that the proposed framework significantly
	outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches for combining link and
	content analysis for community detection.},

  abstract = {Graphs or networks can be used to model complex systems. Detecting
	community structures from large network data is a classic and challenging
	task. In this paper, we propose a novel community detection algorithm,
	which utilizes a dynamic process by contradicting the network topology
	and the topology-based propinquity, where the propinquity is a measure
	of the probability for a pair of nodes involved in a coherent community
	structure. Through several rounds of mutual reinforcement between
	topology and propinquity, the community structures are expected to
	naturally emerge. The overlapping vertices shared between communities
	can also be easily identified by an additional simple postprocessing.
	To achieve better efficiency, the propinquity is incrementally calculated.
	We implement the algorithm on a vertex-oriented bulk synchronous
	parallel(BSP) model so that the mining load can be distributed on
	thousands of machines. We obtained interesting experimental results
	on several real network data.},
